# ☕ Coffee Shop Website ☕ – Responsive UI Project

📌 **Overview**

This is a beautifully styled, fully responsive Coffee Shop website clone built using only HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate a real-world business landing page for a café or coffee brand, and helped reinforce concepts like layout design, image handling, and section organization.

It’s ideal for understanding how to build multi-section landing pages from scratch using pure frontend fundamentals.
