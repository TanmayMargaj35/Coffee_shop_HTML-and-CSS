☕ Responsive Coffee Shop Website
Personal Project

📌 Overview
This is a beginner-level responsive web project where I cloned a stylish Coffee Shop Website using HTML and CSS. The goal was to understand modern web design patterns, layout structure, and styling fundamentals through a visually rich and organized UI resembling a real-world business website.

This project helped reinforce key front-end development concepts like responsive layouts, flexbox, navigation design, and content sectioning.

🎯 Objectives
Build a responsive multi-section coffee shop landing page

Understand real-world HTML structure for business websites

Improve styling skills using CSS Flexbox and media queries

Learn to organize pages with reusable and aesthetic components

Get familiar with using external icon libraries like Boxicons

🧠 Features
✅ Sticky navigation bar with menu icon

✅ Animated search bar and cart icon

✅ Hero section with a CTA (Call-To-Action)

✅ About Us section with rich content and image

✅ Product showcase grid layout

✅ Customer testimonials with star ratings

✅ Social media links & footer with contact information

✅ Fully responsive layout – works on both desktop & mobile

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
🌐 HTML5

🎨 CSS3

🎯 Boxicons (Icon Library)

🧠 Visual Studio Code

🔗 Git & GitHub

🚀 How It Works
The page is divided into major sections: Navbar, Hero, About, Products, Customers, and Footer

CSS handles layout via Flexbox for responsiveness and alignment

Icons are powered by Boxicons to provide interactivity (cart, stars, search)

Product cards and testimonials are organized using CSS grid-like behavior

Fully responsive across screen sizes (mobile/tablet/desktop)
